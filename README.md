# TeamCity Build Viewer

This web-app provides a bird's-eye view on the build-result history/correlations for big projects to help tackle technical debt towards passing test-benches.

1. Copy config-example.js to config.js and change the values.
1. Add the domain of your tcBuildViewer to the CORS (cross origin resource sharing) list for your TeamCity (read config-example.js for more information)
